# Country Connection Game üåç - Guess The Way
The Country Connection Game is an interactive guessing game where players must connect two given countries by identifying neighboring countries that form a valid path between them. The goal is to find a continuous chain of neighboring countries without missing any links.

## Rules
You are given two countries, e.g., Ukraine and Spain.
Guess the countries that lie between them and form a path of neighbors.
Example: Ukraine ‚Üí Poland ‚Üí Germany ‚Üí France ‚Üí Spain.
Each guessed country must directly border the previous one.
Misspelled countries or countries that are not neighbors will not be accepted.
The order of guesses does not matter, but all required countries must be included.

## Features
- A complete map of European countries and their neighbors.
- Automatic validation of guesses to ensure correctness.
- Flexible input: the order of guessed countries does not matter, as long as the path is complete. - This took a while to make and test
- Educational and fun: improve your geography knowledge while solving puzzles.
